# Eventique â€“ Secure Version (Based on EventRentify)

This repository is a security-enhanced version of the original **EventRentify** event rental platform, developed as part of the *Secure Web Application Development* module. It builds upon the completed EventRentify full-stack project by implementing key security measures to protect user data, sessions, and transactions.

## What Was Improved

This version includes the following enhancements:
- âœ… Email verification during registration  
- âœ… Session validation to prevent unauthorized access  
- âœ… User input sanitization and secure routing  
- âœ… Custom error handling and feedback messages  
- âœ… Secure reservation and profile update processes

## Base Project Overview

The original [EventRentify](https://github.com/purnimabohara/EventRentify-Frontend) platform was designed to streamline Nepalâ€™s fragmented event rental market, offering users the ability to rent items, track bookings, and manage vendors on a centralized platform.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives (Security + UX)

- Improve application **resilience against common web vulnerabilities**  
- Enhance **user trust and interaction safety** through better validation  
- Maintain an accessible, user-friendly interface following UX heuristics  
- Apply industry security practices (error feedback, session control, route protection)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Security Layer**: Express middleware, auth validation, feedback alerts

## Skills Demonstrated

- Business analysis: Identifying security gaps in the user journey  
- UX testing: Ensuring added validations didnâ€™t disrupt the user experience  
- Secure development: Implementing protections for data integrity and session control
